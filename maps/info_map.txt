The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:
	0 for an empty space,
	1 for a wall,
	C for a collectible,
	E for a map exit,
	P for the player’s starting position.

The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible,
	and 1 starting position to be valid.

The map must be rectangular.

The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.
	If it’s not, the program must return an error.

You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.

You must be able to parse any kind of map,
	as long as it respects the above rules.

If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file,
	the program must exit in a clean way,
	and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
